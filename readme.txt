you need the 
http://github.com/clemens/localized_dates/tree/master
plugin for the dates localization.

this scaffold copies a bunch of files I use for my projects, such as css styles, a German i18n yaml file etc. I also have a nested scaffold for the german language which uses some of the files I copy here.
